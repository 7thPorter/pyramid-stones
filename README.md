# Pyramid Stones

A small app to resolve a question put to me for a prospective job interview. Overall, the idea is to send boats from place to place along the Nile river, loading the boats with stones at the quarry, and offloading them at the build site, while tallying how many boats have been offloaded in a given amount of time. 

As of 1/27/2022, I am no longer working on this code. It's almost complete in terms of what its intended purpose was, although there is a lingering bug which is causing my boats to travel, laod, and unload at twice the speed they should be. I'll likely return to this code in the future, but for now, I'm putting it on the shelf.
